# elename ðŸ¥¼
Get elements from any words. This is just a useless fun website I made to get
elements from me and my friend's names.

## What it does ðŸ¥½
For example, my name is Rakin. If I input this name, the website will print all
the elements available in it.

**Rakin** -> **Radium**, **Potassium**, **Iodine**, **Nitrogen**

Radium comes from "Ra" in **Ra**kin, Potassium comes from 'K' in Ra**k**in and
so on.
